Final Project Proposal

Welcome to Groovy’s Pizza!

My final project is to make a website for a fictitious pizza company, Groovy’s Pizza LLC. On the

website, customers can select pizzas, appetizers, desserts, and drinks and order online. The

customer has to provide his/her address and credit card details for placing the order. The

website will have some of these unique features as well:

1. Customer can select pizza, appetizers, desserts and drinks and order everything using

guest account. Customer will have an option to create an account which will

remember his/her details when he/she comes next time like credit card number and

address.

2. Customer can rate the pizza and write reviews. Admin of website has to approve the

reviews.

3. Customers will be able to filter pizzas based on the ratings.

I will concentrate my efforts on the pizza portion of the website; if time allows, I will also have

the same functionality available for the appetizers, drinks, etc.
